/**
 * @brief GroupSelectableTrait is a state trait that provides single-selection
 * (mutual exclusion / radio) behavior to a View.
 *
 * GroupSelectable implies Selectable implies Interactive. A View with
 * GroupSelectableTrait also has SelectableTrait behavior (a boolean selected
 * state and SelectionChangedSignal) and InteractiveTrait behavior (click
 * handling, pressed state). GroupSelectableTrait derives from SelectableTrait
 * so callers can use the returned handle for grouping, selection, and
 * interactive APIs alike.
 *
 * A grouped member belongs to a SelectionGroup that enforces "only one
 * selected". Membership is DECLARATIVE, established through one of exactly two
 * mechanisms with a fixed precedence (a set name always wins over parent-auto):
 *  1. Parent auto-grouping (default, no setup): a View made GroupSelectable that
 *     is on-scene under a View parent and has no group name auto-joins that
 *     parent's group. This membership is scene-scoped: the member leaves the
 *     parent group when it goes off-scene and re-joins on reconnection.
 *  2. Named grouping: SetGroupName(name) joins the named group
 *     SelectionGroup::Find(name) eagerly (cross-parent, persistent across scene
 *     connection cycles). Setting a name suppresses parent auto-grouping;
 *     clearing it (SetGroupName("")) falls back to parent-auto when on-scene.
 *
 * Clicking the already-selected member is a no-op (true radio); a group never
 * becomes empty through a gesture, only through a non-gesture route such as
 * SelectionGroup::ClearSelection() or a programmatic SetSelected(false) on the
 * selected member.
 *
 * Internally the interactive, selectable, and group-selectable trait
 * implementations share the single core interaction trait slot.
 *
 * @note InteractiveTrait, SelectableTrait, and GroupSelectableTrait are facets of a
 * single shared interaction object on a View. Comparing handles with operator== compares
 * that same underlying object, and DownCast is presence-based (does the requested facet's
 * sub-implementation exist?) rather than identity-based.
