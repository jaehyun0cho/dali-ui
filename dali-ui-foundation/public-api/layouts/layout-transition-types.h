 * @brief Selects how far a CHANGE transition reaches into the view tree.
 *
 * A LayoutTransition normally animates only the DIRECT children of the view

 * immediate parent also carries a transition. @c SUBTREE removes that
 * requirement for the CHANGE slot: one transition on a container reflows the
 * whole subtree under it with a single timing.
 *
 * Scope resolution: a node is animated by the CLOSEST ancestor that has a
 * transition. That ancestor reaches the node when it is the node's direct
 * parent, or when its scope is @c SUBTREE. A descendant that has its own
 * transition becomes the closest ancestor for its own children, so a
 * @c SUBTREE scope does not cross it (no double animation).
 *
 * @note Applies to CHANGE, and to ENTER / EXIT when the owner carries the
 * corresponding slot effect: a child added under a no-transition descendant
 * fires the owner's ENTER, and a child removed via
 * @c View::Remove(child, RemovePolicy::ANIMATE_EXIT) / @c View::RemoveAll(RemovePolicy::ANIMATE_EXIT)
 * fires the owner's EXIT (an immediate remove — the inherited
 * @c Actor::Remove or @c RemovePolicy::IMMEDIATE — is not deferred). The effect is sourced from the
 * owner while geometry and the EXIT ghost use the child's real direct parent.
 * The closest transition-bearing ancestor always wins, so a descendant with its
 * own transition governs its own subtree. Inherited descendants resolve their
 * CHANGE timing with @c LayoutChangeCause::OTHER (or @c WINDOW_RESIZED during a
 * window resize), so a default CHANGE timing or animator should be configured
 * for @c SUBTREE CHANGE to take effect. @c SUBTREE does not cross a standalone
 * layout-mode boundary.
