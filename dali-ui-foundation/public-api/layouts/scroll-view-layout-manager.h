/**
 * @brief Implements the scroll view layout algorithm.
 *
 * ScrollViewLayoutManager allows content to have its natural size without
 * being constrained by the parent size, except when the child uses MatchParent
 * in which case the ScrollView's size is used as constraint.
 *
 * This layout manager is primarily designed for ScrollView to enable
 * scrolling of content that can be larger than the viewport. Scrollable
 * dimension updates only take effect when attached to a ScrollView; for
 * general layout use cases prefer the other LayoutManager subclasses.
