/**
 * @brief SelectionGroup enforces single-selection (radio) semantics across a set of Views.
 *
 * A SelectionGroup is a controller/observer for a set of GroupSelectable Views that share
 * single-selection (radio) behaviour: at most one member can be selected at a time, and
 * selecting a member automatically deselects the previously selected one. Clicking a
 * member always selects it; clicking the already-selected member is a no-op (true radio
 * behaviour). A gesture can never empty the group. The group becomes empty (no selected
 * member) only through a non-gesture route: ClearSelection() or a programmatic
 * SetSelected(false) on the selected member's SelectableTrait.
 *
 * Membership is DECLARATIVE and is NOT established through this handle. A View becomes a
 * member through one of exactly two mechanisms (precedence: name wins over parent-auto):
 *  1. Parent auto-grouping (default): an AsGroupSelectable() View that is on-scene under a
 *     View parent and has no group name auto-joins that parent's group (scene-scoped).
 *  2. Named grouping: GroupSelectableTrait::SetGroupName(name) joins a named group
 *     (cross-parent, persistent). A set name always overrides parent auto-grouping.
 *
 * A SelectionGroup handle is OBTAINED, not created, via the Find() factories. Find(name)
 * returns the named group (creating it on first lookup); Find(parentView) returns the
 * parent auto-group. The same group is returned for the same key, so an application can
 * observe and control a declaratively-formed group.
 *
 * The group does not extend its members' lifetime: it tracks members by raw, non-owning
 * pointers and auto-unregisters each member when it is destroyed, so it never holds a
 * dangling pointer. The Find() registries hold the group only weakly, so a group is freed
 * once its last handle and last member are gone.
 *
 * @code
 *   // Named group: two Views in different parents share one selection.
 *   radioA.AsGroupSelectable().SetGroupName("payment");
 *   radioB.AsGroupSelectable().SetGroupName("payment");
 *   SelectionGroup group = SelectionGroup::Find("payment");
 *   group.SelectedMemberChangedSignal().Connect(&MyClass::OnRadioChanged);
 *
 *   // Parent auto-group: children of an on-scene parent are mutually exclusive.
 *   parent.Add(optionA.AsGroupSelectable());
 *   parent.Add(optionB.AsGroupSelectable());
 *   SelectionGroup parentGroup = SelectionGroup::Find(parent);
