/**
 * @brief Per-window dispatcher that animates layout transitions.
 *
 * Owned by LayoutControllerImpl. Around each layout pass it walks the
 * subtree of every layout root, collects every View that has a
 * LayoutTransition attached, and dispatches the ENTER / EXIT / CHANGE
 * slots for each transition-attached view's children:
 *
 *   - @c CaptureBeforeLayout: DFS-collects transition-attached views and
 *     snapshots each direct child's previous arranged bounds.
 *   - @c StartTransitionsAfterLayout: for each transition-attached view,
 *     compares new arranged bounds against the snapshot. New children
 *     fire ENTER, removed children (handled separately via
 *     ScheduleExit / View::Remove) fire EXIT, and remaining
 *     children whose bounds changed fire CHANGE.
 *   - @c TickAnimators: every frame, advances elapsed time on active
 *     animator-mode states and invokes their callbacks.
 *
 * Each slot supports either spec mode (declarative ViewAnimationSpec /
 * LayoutTransitionTiming applied via dali-core Animation) or animator-callback
 * mode (per-frame application callback that drives the actor properties
 * directly).
