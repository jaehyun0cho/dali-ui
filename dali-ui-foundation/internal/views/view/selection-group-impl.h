/**
 * @brief Internal implementation of SelectionGroup.
 *
 * SelectionGroupImpl owns the cross-View single-selection (radio) state for a set of
 * member trait implementations. It is the analogue, one level up, of how
 * CoreInteractionObject's trait implementations collaborate: a member's
 * GroupSelectableTraitImpl holds a STRONG reference to its SelectionGroupImpl, while the
 * group holds only RAW (non-owning) pointers to the member trait implementations, so
 * there is no ownership cycle.
 *
 * Membership is keyed on the stable GroupSelectableTraitImpl* identity (NOT on a View
 * handle), so a member can be unregistered deterministically even while its View is
 * being destroyed (when its WeakHandle<View> already resolves empty). The trait
 * implementations are owned by CoreInteractionObject (via std::unique_ptr) and notify
 * the group from OnViewDestroying() before they are destroyed, so the group never holds
 * a dangling pointer.
 *
 * The group never drives selection by intercepting it (there is no veto). It collaborates
 * purely through the trait's selection signal: when a member reports that it became
 * selected, the group records the new winner and deselects the previous one.
