/**
 * @brief Internal implementation of GroupSelectable trait.
 *
 * GroupSelectableTraitImpl is stored inside CoreInteractionObject alongside the
 * InteractiveTraitImpl and SelectableTraitImpl. It implements single-selection
 * (radio / mutual exclusion) by collaborating with a SelectionGroupImpl through
 * signals only:
 *
 *  - The interaction wiring is GATED ON GROUP MEMBERSHIP. While the member is
 *    bound to a group it disables the sibling SelectableTrait's toggle-by-click
 *    and instead connects a SELECT-ONLY handler to the InteractiveTrait
 *    ClickedSignal. The handler always requests SetSelected(true), never
 *    toggles, so clicking the already-selected member is a free no-op (true
 *    radio) via the SelectableTraitImpl no-op guard. While the member is
 *    ungrouped (AsGroupSelectable() with no group name and not under a parent's
 *    auto-group, or after it has left its group) it behaves exactly as a plain
 *    Selectable: toggle-by-click is left at its
 *    pre-join value and no select-only handler is installed.
 *  - The selection observer is MEMBERSHIP-INDEPENDENT: it stays connected to
 *    the sibling SelectableTrait SelectionChangedSignal for the whole attached
 *    lifetime, no-opping while mGroup is null. When this member becomes selected
 *    (and is grouped) it notifies its SelectionGroupImpl, which records the new
 *    winner and deselects the previous winner.
 *
 * It also keeps the member's accessibility in lock-step: RADIO_BUTTON role on
 * join, CHECKED state mirrored to the selected state via read-modify-write.
 *
 * On top of the binding/arbitration core above, this trait implements the
 * DECLARATIVE membership layer. A member's group is resolved from exactly two
 * mutually-exclusive sources, name winning over parent-auto:
 *  - mGroupName (explicit name): bound eagerly to SelectionGroup::Find(name).
 *  - mAutoGroupParent (parent-auto, scene-scoped): when no name is set and the
 *    owner is on-scene under a View parent, bound to SelectionGroup::Find(parent)
 *    and left on scene disconnection.
 * The declarative layer only chooses WHICH group; it binds/unbinds through the
 * core JoinGroup()/LeaveGroup() path, preserving all arbitration and the P2
 * fixes. To observe the owner's scene lifetime it connects to the owner View's
 * OnScene/OffScene signals (membership-independent, dropped on teardown).
